#Car over rough terrain with Matter.js

This is an excerpt from a project where I built a little simulation of a car driving over rough terrain as part of a page designed to sell that car. It involves a custom constructor that was built with legacy code from that project in mind, hence the defaults in the constructor.

#How to run this project

You will need gulp and bower:

```
npm install -g gulp bower
```

Then you will need to install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Then, to run the project and serve locally, simply run:

```
gulp serve
```
